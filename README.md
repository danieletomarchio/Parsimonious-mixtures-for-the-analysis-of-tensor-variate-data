# Parsimonious-mixtures-for-the-analysis-of-tensor-variate-data

This repository contains the code for fitting parsimonious mixtures of tensor-variate shifted exponential normal (TVSEN), tensor-variate tail inflated normal (TVTIN), and tensor-variate normal (TVN) distributions.
In the following, you find a description of the functions (and their arguments) contained in the Tensor-mixtures.R file.
